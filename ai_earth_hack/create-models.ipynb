Studies show that approximately 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced since 1950, and 60% of that plastic ends up in either our landfills or the natural environment. This contributes greatly to pollution, harms wildlife, affects human health, and exacerbates climate change.   \n",
    "Solution: To alleviate this problem, we propose developing a consumer-friendly, easy-to-use app that manages and optimises the reverse logistics of packaging. Imagine this: when purchasing a product, consumers will pay a one-time fee for reusable packaging. After use, they can return the empty packaging via designated collection points or direct pickup services. The app will facilitate this process by tracking, scheduling pickups or locating nearby collection points. The packaging is then cleaned and reused, thereby reducing the need for new plastic production and ensuring the packaging circulates within the economy, instead of ending up as waste. This app will not only help consumers make more sustainable choices but also incentivise producers to shift towards a circular economy model.\n",

    "Solution: E waste has always been a growing problem in the world. The inclusion of circular economy techniques in our day to day life can bring about a huge change in this context. The consumer electronic goods that remains idle in our homes or is inoperative can be thought of as a means to implement the idea. If there exists a system which can collect the inoperative home consumer goods, extract the different parts like transistors, diodes, etc and make it to use in future products, I think it may reduce the problem of e waste marginally. Even if the parts are damaged, in some cases, trying to repair them can be much more cheap way than building a new component altogether. Thus even the manufacturing cost can be reduced. Also, there can be a quick supply of electronic components in the market. \n",
    "There can also be a responsible framework of second hand consumer electronic goods. Thus even the poor people can afford the best of consumer electronics without spending much from their pocket. This will include more people in the consumer electronics market which can in turn improve the market forces.\n",
