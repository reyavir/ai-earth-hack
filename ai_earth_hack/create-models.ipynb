    "Problem: Single-use plastic packaging has become an all-too-common sight in our environment, resulting in detrimental environmental impacts. Studies show that approximately 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced since 1950, and 60% of that plastic ends up in either our landfills or the natural environment. This contributes greatly to pollution, harms wildlife, affects human health, and exacerbates climate change.   \n",
    "Solution: To alleviate this problem, we propose developing a consumer-friendly, easy-to-use app that manages and optimises the reverse logistics of packaging. Imagine this: when purchasing a product, consumers will pay a one-time fee for reusable packaging. After use, they can return the empty packaging via designated collection points or direct pickup services. The app will facilitate this process by tracking, scheduling pickups or locating nearby collection points. The packaging is then cleaned and reused, thereby reducing the need for new plastic production and ensuring the packaging circulates within the economy, instead of ending up as waste. This app will not only help consumers make more sustainable choices but also incentivise producers to shift towards a circular economy model.\n",
